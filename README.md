Starting to learn C++ by creating and testing Data Structures and Algorithms from scratch.

## Data Structures
- [x] Stack - Testing Needed
- [x] Queue - Testing Needed
- [ ] Linked List - In progress
- [ ] Map

## Algorithms
#### Searching Algorithms
- [ ] Linear Search
- [ ] Binary Search
#### Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort

May add more data structures in the future
> e.g. variations of maps, trees, queues etc
